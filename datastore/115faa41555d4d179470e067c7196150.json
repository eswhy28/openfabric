DNA is a long string of nucleotides that is found in all living things. It is made up of two parts: the nucleotide base (A, T, C, G, A, C) and the complementary strand (C, G). The nucleotide bases are the building blocks of DNA. The complementary strand is the part of the DNA that is not part of a nucleotide. It consists of a sequence of nucleotide repeats (called nucleotidylates) that are found in the DNA. The repeats are called nucleotids because they are made up by repeating the same sequence of DNA nucleotide bases. . -DNA sequence -Nucleotide base ."]}}
