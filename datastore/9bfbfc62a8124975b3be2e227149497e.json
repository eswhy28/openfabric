The DNA sequence is the sequence of nucleotides (letters) in the DNA molecule. The nucleotide is the unit of information in DNA. The DNA sequence consists of a set of nucleotide bases (letters). The nucleotide base is the smallest unit of the DNA. DNA is made up of two types of nucleic acids: adenine and guanine. The adenines are the building blocks of DNA. They are found in the nucleotidic units of DNA, and are the bases that make up the DNA's DNA sequence. The guanines are found at the ends of the nucleotide units. They make up DNA's double helix. , the nucleic acid bases are arranged in a chain. The chain is made of two nucleotide strands. The first strand is called the \"A\" strand and the second strand is the \"G\" strand. The \"A strand\" is the base of the chain. . The A strand is made from the base A. The G strand is a strand of DNA that is made by the addition of a guanidine."]}}
