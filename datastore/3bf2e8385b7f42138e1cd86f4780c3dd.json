The idea of a world where gravity is absent is not new. In fact, it's been around for a long time. But the idea of an empty universe is a new one. . The universe is made up of matter and energy. The energy is the energy of the universe. The matter is the matter of the world. In the beginning, the universe was empty. It was empty because there was no energy. But the energy came from the Big Bang. And the Big Crunch. So the universe is filled with energy. And the energy is made of matter. Now, the energy can be used to create matter. But it can also be used for other things. For example, the sun can be made of energy. But if you want to make a rocket, you need to use the energy to make the rocket. Or you can use the sun to make other things, like a spaceship. This is the idea behind the Big Freeze. If you freeze the universe, you can make it into a new universe. You can make a new world. You can make the universe into a universe."]}}
